    <p>The area that would become St. Louis was a center of the Native American Mississippian culture, which built numerous temple
    and residential earthwork mounds on both sides of the Mississippi River. Their major regional center was at Cahokia Mounds,
    active from 900 AD to 1500 AD. Due to numerous major earthworks within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the
    "Mound City." These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area
    included the Siouan-speaking Osage people, whose territory extended west, and the Illiniwek. European exploration of the
    area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette traveled through the Mississippi
    River valley. Five years. <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis#Mississippian_culture_and_early_exploration" >For more information</a></p>

 <p>Our academic programming views the learning pathway as part of a broader transdisciplinary framework of development and well-being.
Conditions associated with education and youth development represent a problem space where persistent engagement and planning
across political boundaries, health care providers, youth serving organizations, and educational institutions are critical.</p>
