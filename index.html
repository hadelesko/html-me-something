<p>News from from our city</p>
<div bgcolor="green"  align= "justify">
    <p>The area that would become St. Louis was a center of the Native American Mississippian culture, which built numerous temple
    and residential earthwork mounds on both sides of the Mississippi River. Their major regional center was at Cahokia Mounds,
    active from 900 AD to 1500 AD. Due to numerous major earthworks within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the
    "Mound City." These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area
    included the Siouan-speaking Osage people, whose territory extended west, and the Illiniwek. European exploration of the
    area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette traveled through the Mississippi
    River valley. Five years. <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis#Mississippian_culture_and_early_exploration" >For more information</a></p>

 <p><h1>Education</h1></p>
 <p>This is the story of public education in St. Louis and the challenges it has faced, an instructive tale in an era when the U.S. president and education secretary are intent on increasing alternatives to traditional public schools.

Rich in history and detail, the piece is long, but worth the time. It was written by Jeff Bryant, Jeff Bryant, director of the Education Opportunity Network, a partnership effort of the Institute for America’s Future and the Opportunity to Learn Campaign. Bryant, who describes what he learned during his recent travels to St. Louis, has written extensively about public education policy.

“This is a disaster.”

Walker Gaffney and I were at the entry of Cleveland High School in St. Louis. Broken glass speckles the floor. Black mold crawls up the sides of the stone walls. Rotted plaster hangs from the high arched ceiling.

“It’s worse every time I come here,” said Gaffney, who is the school district’s real estate director. “I once found a dog-fighting operation in one of these old schools.”</p>
