<p>News from from our city</p>

    <p>The area that would become St. Louis was a center of the Native American Mississippian culture, which built numerous temple
    and residential earthwork mounds on both sides of the Mississippi River. Their major regional center was at Cahokia Mounds,
    active from 900 AD to 1500 AD. Due to numerous major earthworks within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the
    "Mound City." These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area
    included the Siouan-speaking Osage people, whose territory extended west, and the Illiniwek. European exploration of the
    area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette traveled through the Mississippi
    River valley. Five years. <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis#Mississippian_culture_and_early_exploration" >For more information</a></p>
